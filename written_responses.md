1. What is a regular expression and how does it work?

	A regular expression is a sequence of characters that can be used to find strings that match a specific pattern. Regular expressions are powerful because of their abstract nature. Instead of searching for a specific word or digit sequence we can search for strings that match a certain form.  For example, you can find all strings that have 4 or more characters by using the wild card character '.' 4 times in a row. You could also search for strings that begin with 'boo' by using the regular expression boo.* where the '.*' matches any character repeated 0 or more times. Regular expressions make it easy to identify things like phone numbers, student ID's, social security numbers, or dates by searching for specific formats of digits.


2. What is an array and how does it work?

	An array is a data structure that can store multiple elements under one variable's name. The elements are accessed by their index. For example, if an array of size 4 is created and we want to add the entries "Horse", "Dog", "Cat", "Mouse", we can specify where in the array each entry will go. The usual syntax for this across programming languages would look like this: animals[0] = "Mouse" or animals[3] = "Horse". This places the string Mouse in the first position of the array and the string "Horse" in the last position. An array is probably the simplest and most common data structure because its structure is very similar to how data is stored in a computer's memory and it is a natural fit to solve a large variety of problems. Arrays do have some important limitations however. One of them is that the size of an array must be specified when it is created. This requires knowing or guessing the approximate amount of data that the program will eventually need to store in the array. Needless to say, this is not always possible. Another drawback for arrays is the need to shift elements to the right when a new entry is added towards the beginning. This negatively affects the performance of certain algorithms, effectively limiting the array implementation of many algorithms to running in quadratic time. 

3. What is a hash table and how does it work?

	A hash table is a data structure that was created in order to perform quick searches on data. When searching for a value in an array or binary tree we are required to step through the data and compare each successive value with the value we are searching for. This approach ends up running in logarithmic time at best. Hash tables are a clever way to do look ups in constant time and are therefore often the go-to data structure when we know we will be doing a lot of searching. Hash tables work by running each value through a formula which determines their final position in memory. The formula always produces the same result so if I insert 'Donald Duck' into my hash table today, the formula (or the hash) will determine where it should be placed and when I go to search for 'Donald Duck' again tomorrow at the formula will point to the same exact spot in memory. Although hash tables are powerful and elegant, they are not suitable to every application. For example, finding the maximum or minimum element in a list will not be efficient in a hash table.
